        <h3 id="reading-reading-and-more-reading-">Reading reading and more reading...</h3>
        <p>Ive been reading even more articles for the past few days, today Ive been focusing on different design principles for screen interfaces like flat design, material design and skeumorfic design. I guess this is a subject that I will cover regardless of where the undecided methodology takes me. Ive been briefed on the HBO project, which at this time is unfortunatly not moving forward in a direction that I can incorporate within the spectrum of my thesis. I will however join a meeting tomorrow with the team, and introduce them to my vision and plans. Hopefully there are aspects within the context but with a more general use for the company that I can tackle. </p>
        <p>I also started to go through the piles of VR games and experiences that we have in the office, documenting the interaction methods and interface decision. I will also set up an expert-interview with one of the VR guys next week, with the hopes of determine the current status of VR interfaces and interactions.</p>

        <h3 id="now-i-ve-started-for-real-">Now I’ve started for real!</h3>
        <p>For the last week I’ve been working in the office of North Kingdom. My main focus for this week has been to get everything set up (tool for writing report, git repo and logbook solution).  I’ve also been reading a lot, and I mean A LOT of scientific papers on VR in general, interaction and interfaces in VR and most of all about tools and techniques that are used for interacting in VR. I try to only read papers that I can use to back my method and decisions on, even though my subject and focus is quite abstract and unclear at the moment.</p>
        <p>My original direction for the thesis has been about evaluating design principles used for screens when applied to VR. My assumption was that those principles were used in the majority of applications today, but based on the articles I’ve been reading the industry has moved past this already. I’ve shifted more and more towards reading about selection and interaction tools. This is an interesting subject that has been researched a lot in the past, which have so far presented me with the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interaction tools and techniques are strongly dependant on the context of the application.</li>
          <li>Using a ray (laserpointer) to interact is prefered over a “simulated hand” when interaction with menus that are sparse with few sizable objects. In a more dynamic environment that requires more precision different pointer-techniques are better.</li>
          <li>Using a simulated hand is really intuitive and provides an option for delicate and precise interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next week I’m going to (hopefully) be briefed on the HBO project and set a context for my research, which would help tremendously. Until then I’ll keep catching up on the latest reseach, I’ve been working my way up from 1992 to 2012 so far.</p>
