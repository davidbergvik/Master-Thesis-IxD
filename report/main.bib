@book{interview:Hall2013,
abstract = {Design research is a hard slog that takes years to learn and time away from the real work of design, right? Wrong. Good research is about asking more and better questions, and thinking critically about the answers. It's something every member of your team can and should do, and which everyone can learn, quickly. And done well, it will save you time and money by reducing unknowns and creating a solid foundation to build the right thing, in the most effective way. In Just Enough Research, co-founder of Mule Design Erika Hall distills her experience into a brief cookbook of research methods. Learn how to discover your competitive advantages, spot your own blind spots and biases, understand and harness your findings, and why you should never, ever hold a focus group. You'll start doing good research faster than you can plan your next pitch. Erika Hall has been working in web design and development since the late 20th century. In 2001, she co-founded Mule Design Studio where she directs the research, interaction design, and strategy practices. Erika speaks and writes frequently about cross-disciplinary collaboration and the importance of natural language in user interfaces. In her spare time, she battles empty corporate jargon at Unsuck It. She also co-hosts Running from the Law, a weekly podcast on business law and endurance fitness, and can probably outrun you.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional user interfaces (3D UIs) support user tasks in many non-traditional interactive systems such as virtual environments and augmented reality. Although 3D UI researchers have been successful in identifying basic user tasks and interaction metaphors, evaluating the usability of 3D interaction techniques, and improving the usability of many applications, 3D UI research now stands at a crossroads. Very few fundamentally new techniques and metaphors for 3D interaction have been discovered in recent years, yet the usability of 3D UIs in many real-world applications is still not at a desirable level. What directions should 3D UI researchers next explore to improve this situation? In this paper, we make some observations about the history of 3D UIs and the current state-of-the-art. Using this evidence, in addition to our own experience, we argue that 3D UI researchers should approach this problem using some new research approaches, which cluster around the concepts of specificity, flavors, implementation, and emerging technologies. We illustrate and discuss some of these new directions using case studies of research projects undertaken in our group. These explorations indicate the promise of these directions for further increasing our understanding of 3D interaction and 3D UI design, and for ensuring the usability of 3D UIs in future applications.},

We present implementations and discussion of six techniques which allow manipulation of remote objects. A user study of these techniques was performed which revealed their characteristics and deficiencies, and led to the development of a new class of techniques. These hybrid techniques provide distinct advantages in terms of ease of use and efficiency because they consider the tasks of grabbing and manipulation separately.},

abstract = {Developing virtual reality (VR) applications which enable actual work over a period of time requires optimization of the most basic interactions, such as object manipulation, so that the immersed participant can concentrate on higher-level tasks rather than on low-level motor activities. This paper presents a framework and experimental testbed for studies of VR object manipulation techniques. The framework provides a systematic task analysis of immersive manipulation and suggests a user-specific non-Euclidean system for the measurement of VR spatial relationships. The Virtual Reality Manipulation Assessment Testbed (VRMAT) is a practical implementation of the framework and is a flexible tool allowing in-depth experimental studies of immersive manipulation. Pilot studies have been conducted to evaluate this framework and testbed and to establish a baseline for further development.},

Unlike previous AR interfaces, this approach allows users to interact with virtual content using natural hand gestures.
