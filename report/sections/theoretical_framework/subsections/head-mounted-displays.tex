\section{Head-mounted Displays}
The most common way of imerging yourself in a virtual environment is with a Head-mounted Display (HMD). This device is placed on the head of the user with two diplays, one for each eye. The displays produce slightly different images which creates a stereoscopic view when percieved through the HMD. The experience is called stereopsis. \cite{HMD:goldstein2016sensation}
