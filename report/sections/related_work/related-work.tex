\chapter{Related Work}
There has been a lot of research in the field of Virtual Reality and manipulating a virtual environment, most recent summarized by Jankowski in 2015. \cite{interactions:Jankowski2015} Further reading about specific techniques and tools can be found in Section \ref{theory:toolsandtech}. There have been a number of studies and implementations of systems that manipulates 3D environments using a HMD. The first major stride within this was in a study Butterworth in 1992 where a 3D surface modeling program was developed. \cite{relatedwork:Butterworth1992} This system was created using the same principles as CAD \footnote{http://www.autodesk.com/solutions/3d-cad-software} and similar software withing 3D object creation and manipulation. Since then there has been numerous other studies and applications withing 3D object creation with a HMD \cite{relatedwork:bowman1996conceptual} \cite{relatedwork:moshell1995research} \cite{relatedwork:liang1994jdcad}

Aswell as for the objects themselves, there has been soem studies about using a HMD to manipulate 3D objects in relation to a virtual environment. This approach is not as focused on 3D modelling as much as postitioning and scaling of pre-fabricated objects in a 3D environment. In a study by Stoakley in 1995 a system called World in Miniature (WIM) was created.\cite{relatedwork:stoakley1995virtual} The premis of this system is to display a miniature version of the virtual environment aswell as the full-scale one. This allows the user to perform delicate manipulations at full scale, and bigger more fundamental changes on the miniature version. The user is holding a clipboard in one hand which represents the miniature world, and a interactive ball in the other for selecting and manipulating in 3D space. The same year, Mine introduced the "Immersive Simulation
Animation And Construction" system (ISAAC).\cite{relatedwork:mine1995isaac} This system is primarly for designed for scene composition and interactive contstruction of virtual worlds. It tries to take advantage of the possibilities in the virtual world but keep the interaction scheme similar to the real world for easier adaptaion to less experienced users. ISAAC uses multiple types of tools for object manipulation, such as ray-cast and direct manipulation (see Section \ref{theory:toolsandtech}) and multiple tools for the user to travel. This system is more of a showcase then a real-world applicaton, as it demonstrates many of the posibilities with object and scene manipulation with a HMD but does not limit interaction tools or a specific purpose.

There have been some studies about merging a regular workstation for 3D manipulation with a HMD. One of these which had a purpose similar to the objective of this thesis has been researched and developed by Bowman et al. back in 1997. \cite{relatedwork:kijimaand1997transition} The authors investigated how to combine a regular work setup for 3D development with a HMD to remove the repeated transition between the two. Their Augmented Reality (AR) system is based on a real workstation which consists of a computer together with screen, keyboard and mouse. This is combined with a Projective Head Display (PHMD) to create an environment where the user can see projected 3D objects and still be able to use the workstation as usual.
\section{Applications - Tilt Brush}
Since the release of both the Oculus rift \footnote{https://www.oculus.com/rift/} and HTC Vive \footnote{https://www.vive.com/eu/product/} which both have 6 DOF controllers, the number of applications focusing on complex interactions and manipulation has really exploded. One of the most known application is 'Tilt Brush' \footnote{https://www.tiltbrush.com/} for HTC Vive where the user can use the existing handcontrollers as paintbrushes and paint in 3D space. This application highlights many of the interactions that are esential when manipulating a the environment. Some of these are listed below:
\subsection{Creating objects}
Creating an object or in this case a new painting stroke is the core of the application, and can as such be accessed directly with primary triggers on both controllers.
\subsection{Selecting and deleting objects}
Objects (strokes) are targeted by placing a spherical tool (attached to your brush) around the stroke and pressing the same trigger that is used for drawing. The tool is activated by selection on the secondary brush menu.
\subsection{Parameters and setting}
The most common and used tools for what will be painted ( brush-size, undo, deleting strokes etc) are accessed through the primary brush (controller). More complex modifications (brush type, colors etc) are accessed from the secondary brush by activating a menu connected to that brush (controller) and selecting with the other brush.

\subsection{Scale and positioning}
One of the biggest advantages of working in a virtual environment is that you are not bound to the restrictions of your physical relatioonship to the objects that you are working with. By using both controllers and moving them away from eachother, the environment grows and the users scale decreases. The user scale can be enlarged by moving the controllers closer together.
By using a raycast (see Section \ref{theory:toolsandtech}) the user can teleport around in the virtual environment.
