\section{Prototypes}
\label{result:prototypes}
Below is a list of features that members of an experience design core team would prefer to have in the tool in question:
\begin{itemize}
  \item List all features of lo-fi prototype here
  \item More lists
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Lo-Fi}
 Several different sketches and concepts were created to obtain a diversity of interfaces to test. Following concepts and elements where selected for the Hi-fi prototyping phase after tests were conducted on all sketches.

\subsubsection{Main interface - Belt UI}

\subsubsection{UI Selectors}

\subsubsection{Object selection and manipulation}
