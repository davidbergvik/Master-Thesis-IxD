\section{Vrify - A design toolbox for Virtual Reality}
Based on the results from the interviews and the theoretical framework, a toolbox for creative processes and design of VR applications were created. The toolbox were designed based on simple user stories and scenarios. Specifications of the controllers and buttons that are referenced in this section can be found in section \ref{result:hardware}.

\subsection{Lo-Fi Prototypes}
 Several different sketches and concepts were created to obtain a diversity of interfaces to test. A lo-fidelity prototype was developed with these sketches as a foundation, these were later evaluated with simple testing rounds. The concepts and elements in this section where selected for the Hi-fi prototyping phase after these tests.

\subsubsection{Main interface - Belt UI}
The main interface is designed for the users ergonomic position when seated, displayed from the hip of the user.(Figure \ref{fig:lofi:belt-ui}) The main purpose of this interface is to create a new object and place them into the world (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:belt-ui:add}), as well as to change properties of selected object/objects (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:belt-ui:props}). The centered feature in this UI is the scene-hierarchy, from where objects can be selected and created. The purpose of this approach is to introduce the hierarchy to the user as the starting point of the process. The users FOV will look like an extension of a work-bench (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:fov:belt-ui}), and can be accessed by pressing the application-button on the controller.

\subsubsection{User Interface Selectors}
\label{result:lofi:selector}
A selector UI (building from work in section \ref{theory:toolsandtech:selector}) is used to manipulate and interact with objects. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:lofi:fov:selector}, the selector appears next to an object that has been selected and offers actions that are targeted to the selected object. The UI is designed as a pie-menu (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:selector:select}) that grants the oppertunity one level of sub-menus (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:selector:submenu}), similar to the interface of HoloSketch which is described in section \ref{relatedwork}. The selector UI is accessed through the touchpad on the controller (for hardware specs, see section \ref{theory:hardware:controllers}), but is visible as a part of the VE, unlike the interface in HoloSketch which hides all other elements and objects.

\subsubsection{Object selection and manipulation}
Interactions and sequences for selecting and manipulating objects (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:object}) are explained here as scenarios.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Selecting an object} The user points the controller towards object, so that the raycast hits it. Then the user clicks the selection-button to select the targeted object.
  \item \textbf{Moving an object} When the user selects the object, a bounding-box becomes visible around the object along with three axis' and a grid (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:belt-ui:props}). By targeting the bounding-box and holding the selection-button the user can now use the raycast to position the object along the grid. If the user wants to move the object in the third dimension (that is not covered by the grid), grab the grid in a similar fashion and use the raycast to move. It's state is movable by default. Unless changed in the selector UI (section \ref{result:lofi:selector}), it can be moved straight away. The axis' of the grid can be changed using the selector UI.
  \item \textbf{Creating a new object} The user opens the Belt interface and selects the "New Component" button (in the hierarchy section), which displays a new view (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:object:add}). This view contains miniatures all objects that are avaliable to the user. The user finds the desired object, grabs it by holding the selection-button and points in the world to deside its position. the object is represented as a halv-transperant version of itself, and is placed by releasing the selection-button.
  \item \textbf{Duplicating an object} The user selects the object thats desired for duplication then opens the selector UI, then selects the 'Duplicate' option. The menu closes and the user points the ray-cast toward the grid of the original object. An identical half-transperant object appears at the end of the ray, onto to the grid. When the user is satisfied with the position, the selection-button is pressed to create the object in the selected location.
  \item \textbf{Properties of an object} The user opens the Belt UI, then selects an object with the raycast. The selection can be made on the actual object or on the object name in the hierarchy in the UI. When an object is selected, all properties for this object is displayed in the right section of the Belt UI (Figure \ref{fig:lofi:belt-ui:props}). A new property can be added by selecting the "Add property" button.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tilt-Brush Tests}
Concepts that made it through initial testing were drawn in Tilt Brush (see Figure \ref{fig:lofi:tilt})  to visulize how perspectives and field of view works with the concepts in VR. Using the application, frames from different scenarios were sketched out, containing UI's, objects and other visual elements.
