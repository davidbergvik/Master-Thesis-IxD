\section{HDM Evaluation}
\label{result:hardware}
In order to get insights into possibilties and limitations of VR hardware today, two different HMDs were evaluated. The selection were based on avaliability of the HMDs and previous experience by the author. The focus of the evaluation lies in portability, DOF, possible interactions and support by Unity VR Editor. The selected devices are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item HTC Vive
  \item Google Daydream
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hardware specification}
Table \ref{table:result:hardware:spec} consist of the hardware specification from the selected devices.

\subsection{Test Analysis}
Initial tests of the different HMDs were performed by the author to gain insights of what each setup had to offer. This section contains insights and experiences from the author based on usage of the HMDs.
