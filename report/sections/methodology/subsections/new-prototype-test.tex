\section{Evaluation of the refined prototype}
After the final iteration, the prototype was evaluated more thoroughly through user tests and follow-up interviews. The purpose of this evaluation is to asses the usability and need of this VR editor concept. The test was based on a series of tasks that the subjects carried out. Each task used at least one of the modules that where developed based on the inital interviews. The test subjects where developers and designers at North Kingdom with different levels of experience of working with Unity \footnote{https://unity3d.com/unity}. This approach allowed comparisions between experienced and no experience users and test if this concept could work as a mediator-tool between developers and people without experience within programming. After each test an interview was conducted in order to get qualitive data about the perfomance and how this concept works compared to the process that is uswed today. [*** EXPAND THIS SECTION ****]
