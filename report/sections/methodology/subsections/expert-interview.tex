\subsection{Expert Interviews}
As companies in the VR industry are developing a specific pipeline and design process for their VR projects, expert interviews were conducted to get a broad sence of the current practices. The main focus were to get a better understanding of how pipelines and design processes are carried out in VR projects. It also serves as an oppertunity to investigate if the internal processes at North Kingdom were missing some fundamental parts in their design process for Vr projects. In order to get the insights from within other fields and applications of VR the interviews where conducted with professionals from different parts of the industry. One interview was conducted with Elin Sj\"ostr\"om, a UX designer from a VR company called byBrick\footnote{http://www.bybrick.se/}, and another with Joel Ring who is one of the founders of the VR-hub called VR Sverige\footnote{http://vrsverige.se/}.
