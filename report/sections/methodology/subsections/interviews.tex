\section{Interviews}
By conducting interviews with professionals within VR development, design and projects, information about what is lacking today and what opportunities exists was extracted. As these interviews where focused on the individual perspectives, ideas and experiences about the process of creating a VR experience, in-depth interviews where conducted\cite{interview:Boyce2006}. The results can be found in section \ref{result:interviews}
The interview where structured after the "Three Boxes" method, which consists of an introduction, body and conclusion\cite{interview:Hall2013}. The entirety of the interview structures can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:ex-interview-structure} .
