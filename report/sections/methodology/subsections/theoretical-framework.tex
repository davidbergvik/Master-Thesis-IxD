\section{Literature Study}
In order to support the design and implementation in VR, a literature review was conducted on a variety of fields within the VR spectrum. The theory that forms the basis of this project will be collected from the scientific articles, books, periodicals and recognized credible news and blogs. Among the areas that will be studied are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Virtual Reality
\item Virtual Environments \& Interactions
\item Hi-fidelity VR hardware and their applications
\item Interfaces in VR
\item Selection methods and tools in VR
\item Design guidelines For VR
\item VR Editor functionality for VR Hardware
\item Experience Design
\end{itemize}
