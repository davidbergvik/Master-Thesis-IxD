\section{Literature Study}
In order to support the design and implementation in VR, a literature review was conducted on a variety of fields within the VR spectrum. The study icluded topics about VR basics and history, interaction tools and techniques within VR and what kind of applications was released up until February 2017. A brief study of different hardware specifications where also conducted to attain knowlegde about the possibilties within each medium/HMD. The selection of hardware was based on the existing software support for implementation and the design processes that were discovered during interviews (see Section \ref{result:interviews}). The study will for the same reason include work ergonomics and explore what possibilities, restrictions and impact this would have on a VR working environment. Some literature about prototyping in VR was also investigated (Lo- and Hi-fi prototyping for VR) as prototyping was later used as a technique for designing based on the results of the study, which can be found in section \ref{theory}. The literature was collected from scientific articles, books, periodicals and recognized credible news and blogs.
