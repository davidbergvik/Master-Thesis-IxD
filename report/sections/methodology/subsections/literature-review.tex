\section{Literature Study}
In order to support the design and implementation in VR, a literature review was conducted on a variety of fields within the VR spectrum. The study did involve VR basics and history, interaction tools and techniques within VR and what kind of applications was released at the time. A quick study of different hardware specs where also conducted with consideration of the avaliable hardware at the Stockholm office of North Kingdom. The chosen hardware was selected based on the existing software support for implementation and the design process for VR projects at North Kingdom, see section \ref{result:interviews}. As the focus of this thesis will be about professionals in a working environment manipulating objects with precision, the higher end of the hardware spectrum will be investigated along with suitable tools and techniques. The study will for the same reason include work ergonomics and explore what posibilities, restrictions and impact that will have on a VR working environment. As prototypes is a later phase in this thesis, some literature about prototyping in VR will also be investigated (Lo- and Hi-fi prototyping for VR). The literature was be collected from scientific articles, books, periodicals and recognized credible news and blogs.
