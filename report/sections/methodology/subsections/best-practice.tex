\section{Best Practice Evaluation}
Popular applications and tools for creating and manipulating a VE was analyzed as a part of the theoretical framework. This was done to serve as a benchmark and to gain further insights into how solutions are implemented today using different mediums and tools. A total of three applications where analyzed and evaluated; Storyboard VR\footnote{https://www.artefactgroup.com/work/storyboard-vr/}, Tilt Brush\footnote{https://www.tiltbrush.com/} and Vizor\footnote{https://vizor.io/}.
