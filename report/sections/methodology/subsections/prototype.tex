\subsection{Iterative prototyping}
Prototyping is a paradigm that is embodied in the “plan to throw one
away” philosophy of system development [4].
In order to test the concepts from problems that were discovered in the interview phase, interface designs were designed and developed by utilizing iterative prototyping within the design process. Iterative prototyping keeps refining a design by creating partially workingh prototypes and user-testing them at a fast pace to get early and regular observation of the system and interface behavior. One of the main benefits with rapid prototyping is that the approach reveals misunderstandings between
designers and developers and the users. These missunderstandings can originate from
 differences in backgrounds and/or experience

a tool in the specifications of user requirements]
