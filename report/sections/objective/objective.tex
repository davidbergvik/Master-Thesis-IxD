\section{Objective}
The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the use of VR as a tool for designing and developing 3D experiences.

It will also investigate if a userfriendly design of this tool can be used asto bridge the gap between developers and the rest of the core team. By creating a tool that can be used without the knowlage of 3D development, other team members can make direct changes to the 3D experience to show the team their vision and ideas. There would be no need for developers to interpret their vision based on words or drawings.
