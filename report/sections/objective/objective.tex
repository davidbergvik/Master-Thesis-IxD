\section{Objective}
The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the use of VR as a tool for designing and developing 3D experiences.

It will also investigate if a user friendly design incorporated with this tool can be used to bridge the gap between developers and the rest of the core team. If this tool  can be used by other team members to make direct changes to the 3D experience to show the team their vision and ideas. There would be no need for developers to interpret their vision based on words or drawings.
