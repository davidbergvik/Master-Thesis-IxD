\chapter{Introduction}
Creating immersive 3D environments for virtual reality (VR) experiences presents designers and developers with new opportunities and challenges that does not appear when creating experiences on a screen. As the medium for the experience differs from the medium on which it is created, designers and developers have to adapt new design processes and pipeline for creating and manipulating 3D environments in VR. These professionals needs a new toolset to effectivly work with this new medium \footnote{http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/288508/} as it's emerging into an entire industry.\footnote{https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/tmt-pred16-media-virtual-reality-billion-dollar-niche.html} There have been a lot of research within similar fields of 3D manipulation with a Head Mounted Display (HMD),  \cite{relatedwork:kijimaand1997transition} \cite{relatedwork:bowman1996conceptual} \cite{relatedwork:stoakley1995virtual} \cite{relatedwork:mine1995isaac}, but recent technological strides demands new efforts to translate earlier knowledge toward new application of these professions and what tools are needed.\footnote{http://www.marxentlabs.com/job/virtual-reality-jobs/}

%\section{3D Graphics}
Since the world was introduced to computers more than five decades ago, a great number of new professions and companies have emerged and the technology has created more jobs for society. \footnote{https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/17/technology-created-more-jobs-than-destroyed-140-years-data-census} One of the applications that harnesses the power of computer systems are computer graphics, a term coined by William Fetter in 1960. \cite{3D_history:graphics_2017} In the 1990's the graphics took the leap into 3D modelling for the consumer market, and with the increased processing power in todays computers, a user can create complex 3D environments on their personal laptops. 3D designers creates and manipulates 3D environments using powerful computers, high-resolution screens and a number of input tools like pens, pads and keyboards.


%\section{Virtual Reality}
VR is a technology that's been around for decades and has in the last few years developed into a whole new set of entertainment, and keeps getting more traction each year.\cite{VR:mazuryk1996virtual} VR is a concept in which the user is placed in a virtual reality using a headset or other hardware. This is the type of VR we see today, but the concept was used  as far back as the 1800s, with the panoramic paintings that stretches 360 degrees around the spectator. In recent years, the variety of VR headsets has exploded and technology became during 2016 a billion \$-industry and is expected to continue increasing in the coming years\cite{VR_stats:statista}.
This increase created a tremendous increase of available application for VR\footnote{https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/blog/gear-vr-ecosystem-expands-to-include-facebook-360-photos-over-250-apps-and-new-video-content/} and there are as of 2016 hundreds of companies working with developing experiences for this new medium\footnote{http://venturebeat.com/2017/03/08/vr-companies-grew-40-percent-in-2016/}.


%\section{Objective}
The objective of this thesis is to analyze the current process of creating 3D experiences in VR and possible challenges that arise. From the analyzis the use of virtual reality and HMDs when creating an immersive 3D environment will be evaluated. A tool for creating in a 3D environment will then be designed, tested and evaluated in comparison to the tools that are avaliable todaty and as a tool to bridge the knowledge gap between the core project team during concept and prototyping phases.

\section{North Kingdom}
This thesis will be carried out together with the company North Kingdom. The company defines itself as an "experience design company", founded in Skellefte\aa and has been a public company since 2003. Today, the offices of North Kingdom are in Skellefte\aa, Stockholm and Los Angeles. \cite{northkingdom} Their vision is
\begin{quote}
We Believe That new value can be created wherever people, business, and technology collide. We help our clients harness That value through the creation of experiences, products, and services That play a meaningful role in people's lives. Through human-centered design, we make the complex simple and relatable, no matter what medium or platform\cite{northkingdom}.
\end{quote}
This thesis will run in parallel with North Kingdom's current VR projects. Their design process and pipeline will act as the scope for this thesis.
