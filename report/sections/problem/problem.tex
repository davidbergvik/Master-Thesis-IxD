\section{Problem}

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{intro:purpose}
As companies migth shift their focus towards creating experiences in virtual reality, their design process has to be modified. As a part of that, this thesis will evaluate the opportunity of incorporating a tool for manipulating 3D environments while immerged in VR into their new VR design process. This could elevate the experience of creating and using the end product, as designing 3D environments and experiences is highly dependent on the actual perspectives and positions of the end user, and when designing these environments on a screen some aspects of the design becomes hard to predict when seen on a regular screen.

\subsection{Goals}
By allowing the designer and developer to manipulate the environment of their application when immerged might solve issues explained in \ref{intro:purpose} and create a more intuitive user experience during when creating and manipulating objects in the application. By creating a tool that can allow this type of workflow, the goal is for the user to be able to make instant tweaks to the world without having to leave it. An evaluation of this tool will also be conducted, if can be used for rapid prototyping and bridge the knowledge-gap between team-members by letting non-developers edit the prototype to explain their ideas.


\begin{itemize}
	\item Study how VR projects are carried today and identify opportunities where immersion is beneficial
	\item Design VR interfaces that are user-friendly and task specific from the results of the study.
	\item Build functional prototypes based on the final design
	\item These prototypes will be evaluated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
This thesis will be based on the current technology and software on the market. The concepts and prototypes created will be restricted to the possibilities of what can be implemented into a working system today. The scope of what will be investigated is restricted to the field of VR experience and experience design along with its implementations. The targeted user-base will be limited to working professionals within the field of tech and experience design. The hardware HMD selection will be limited to the avaliable hardware at the Stockholm office of North Kingdom.
