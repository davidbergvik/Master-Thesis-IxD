\chapter{Conclusion}
From the building blocks of flow (see section \ref{theory:user-centered:flow}), certain blocks that are relevant for this study can be distinguished. "There is immediate feedback on one's actions" corresponds directly to the procedure where a user is creating on a computer and have to switch context to get feedback. A benefit of a tool like the one explained in this thesis is the lack of computer-to-VR transitions that otherwise exists.
